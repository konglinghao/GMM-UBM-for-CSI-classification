	% Expectation step of the EM Algorithm
	%
	% INPUT:
	% means          : Mean for each Gaussian KxD
	% weights        : Weight vector 1xK for K Gaussians
	% covariances    : Covariance matrices for each gaussian DxDxK
	% X              : Input data NxD
	%
	%%% N is number of data points
	%%% D is the dimension of the data points
	%%% K is number of gaussians

	% OUTPUT:
	% logLikelihood  : Log-likelihood (a scalar).
